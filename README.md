# [EN] Project: HelpDesk Ticket System

Simple **HelpDesk** system for registering and tracking support tickets, developed in C++ and Python as an exercise in structured programming and object-oriented design.  

## Project goals

- Allow users to register tickets with basic information (requester, description, priority, status).
- Manage the support queue (opening, updating, and closing tickets).
- Explore data structure concepts and business logic applied to support systems.

## Technologies used

- C++ (main implementation and/or console version).
- Python (alternative implementation or auxiliary scripts).

## Repository structure

- `DeskHelp.cpp`: C++ implementation of the ticket system.
- `DeskHelp.py`: Python implementation of the ticket system.
- `LICENSE`: GPL-3.0 license that governs the use and distribution of this code.
